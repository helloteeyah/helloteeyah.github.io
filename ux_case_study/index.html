            <h3>Brand Overview</h3>

            <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
            <p>Users of the "About Time Coffee" mobile app are experiencing frustration and inefficiency due to the<span style="font-weight: 700; color:B72424;"> lack of a clear and accessible ordering function.</span> The hidden nature of the <span style="font-weight: 700; color:B72424;"> order tracking feature</span>  results in a significant time investment from users to locate. This design flaw not only impacts customer satisfaction but also potentially affects the frequency of orders and overall user engagement with the app. In order to improve customer satisfaction, I decided to redesign <span style="font-weight: 700; color:B72424;">a clear, efficient, and streamlined ordering process</span> for the app.</p>

            </p>

            <p>I reduced the font size, and it turned out to work better for the aesthetics.</p>

            <p style="color:B72424;">“You forgot to add a back button to the product details page.”</p>

            <p>It turned out that I forgot to add a back button on one of the pages. However, having a back button is essential for an app like this to function properly. I must ensure that a back button is added wherever necessary. </p>

            <p style="color:B72424;">“You should add a payment option, such as entering credit card information and other details.”
            </p>

            <p>It's true that a payment option is essential. I've added a new page for selecting payment methods to make my app more ideal.

            <p style="color:B72424;">“The navigation bar could be transformed into a split design instead of having two circles.”
            </p>

            <p>Instead of transforming it into a split, I created three tabs and placed the order tab in the middle.

            <h5>User Review</h5>
            <p>The general checkout process is very smooth, and the visuals are quite pleasing. However, the back button is difficult to click. Perhaps adding a transparent mask behind it could increase the clickable area. Additionally, since there are many overlays, it's important to reconsider the rationale behind this design choice for progressing to the next steps. Also, consider the methods for navigating within the overlays: whether to click a button or slide down to proceed to the next step, and whether to click outside or add an 'X' button to close the overlay.
            </p>
        
            <h5>What will I do in the future?</h5>
            <p>In the future, I plan to add more components and variants. Currently, some buttons are not clickable, but I will work on completing their functionality to ensure users have a comprehensive experience. Additionally, I need to give more thought to the transitions between each step. Also, I will conduct further user testing. </p>
