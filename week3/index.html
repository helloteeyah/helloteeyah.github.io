        <p>I took this picture in 2012 using my digital camera. It's blurry because the "environment" is too bad</p>

        <p>This pic is taken by Jakub Porzycki and shows exactly "what happened to me" when I was visiting this masterpiece. <br>My pic is earlier than this one because in 2012 smartphones are not that popular yet. The environment actually <br>affects a lot. I'd rather see this artwork online.</p>

        <p>It is one of the exhibit in Seattle Art Museum. I find this is very unique because <br>all the artworks of this artist seem look the same (just like this pic above).</p>

        <img src="/week3/image/fashion.png" alt="very fashion artwork" width="480">

        <p>I took this one in Seattle Art Museum. This artist's exhibit is very refreshing. After seeing some <br>abstract artwork, this "straightforward" painting relaxes my mind. I would associate it with <br>trendy brand stores. I feel like the museum make it more strict.</p>
