        <h2 class="center">BY TIYA WANG</h2>

            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>When facing heavy school tasks, most college students have trouble how properly planning out their time. The failure to manage time might result in stress, low-quality work, waste of time, or bad grades. In order to better achieve their goals in a shorter period of time, I designed a task management mobile app for college students.</p>

            <h3>Ideate</h3>
            <h5>App Features</h5>
            <p>I began by brainstorming the app features with my classmates. In a group of three, we generated some basic functionalities: deadlines, notifications, and categories. Combining each group‚Äôs ideas gave me a general blueprint for the app. </p>
            <br>
            <div class="image">

                <img src="image/appfeature.jpg" alt="app_feature" width="700px">

            </div>
            <br>
            <p>To avoid lengthy and unnecessary work, I identified the <span style="color:B72424;">MVPs</span> my app should have with Professor's help:
            <ul>
                <li>Categories (Different Courses/Different Tasks)</li>
                <li>Priority (Sorted by Your Urgency)</li>
                <li>Reminders (Notification/Calendar)</li>
                <li>Status (Progress/Completion)
                </li>
                <li>Deadlines (Due Dates)</li>
                <li>Customization (Ability to Add Tasks)</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <h5>Mind Map</h5>
        </div>

        <div class="image2">
            <img src="image/mindmap.png" alt="mindmap" width="500px">
        </div>
        <br>

        <div class="ideate">
            <p>Irene, Cindy, and I drew a mind map to visualize all the features the app will have. We also drew connections between each feature putting them into a broad category. </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="design">
            <h3>Design</h3>
            <p>My <span style="color:B72424;">Aims:</span></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Neat looking</li>
                <li>Straightforward icons</li>
                <li>Contains all MVPs</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>Wireframes</h5>
            <p>Based on the MVPs, I designed a wireframe with four main tabs in the menu: <span style="color:B72424;">home, calendar, setting, and self. 
            </span</p>
        </div>

        <br>

        <div id="box2">
            <div class="flex-container">
                
                <div>
                    <img src="image/wire1.png" alt="wire1" width="160px">

                </div>

                <div>
                    <img src="image/wire2.png" alt="wire2" width="160px">
                </div>

                <div>
                    <img src="image/wire3.png" alt="wire3" width="160px">
                </div>

                <div>

                </div>

                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <br>

        <div class="design">

            <h5>User Flow</h5>
            <p>Since my wireframes already have the main functions, I just added a few more pages to make it look more like an app. For example, I created a login page, and also added more details to the original features to enrich the content. Finally, I added interactions between the icons and pages. This made it so much easier for the later prototyping. I could easily follow the app outline and needed only add some colors and design the style.

        <div class="image3">
            <img src="image/user_flow.jpg" alt="user_flow" width="550px">
        </div>
        <br>

        <div class="test">
            <h3>Test</h3>
            <p>I documented all the feedback from my classmates, peers, and professor in Google Docs to keep track of the suggestions for all stages of the project. 
            </p>
            <p style="color:B72424;">‚ÄúThe users cannot tell it's indicating the calendar from the clock icon, maybe change it to the calendar icon.‚Äù
            </p>

            <p>It is confusing to have a calendar page under a timer tab. The users are expecting to see a countdown page. Therefore, I resolved it by changing the icon from the timer to the calendar.</p>

            <p style="color:B72424;">‚ÄúDon't forget to add a delete button‚Äù</p>

            <p>Surprisingly, many of us forgot to add a delete button. However, it's almost impossible to not have a delete button for an app like this to function. </p>

            <p style="color:B72424;">‚ÄúThe calendar looks a little bit messy, you can change it to the actual calendar like what apple has. It will give a clearer layout.‚Äù
            </p>

            <p>The calendar is on a weekly base in my final prototype. I personally will care more about my dues within a week. I think focusing on a week will be a better choice than either a day or a month.

            <h3>Prototype</h3>

            <p>I started to look for design resources before I dive into Figma. I want my app to fulfill <span style="color:B72424;">three things:</span></p>

            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <h5>User Feedback</h5>
            <p>There is one problem using my app: some of the user flows are not connected to each other. The solution is to consider all the interactions and add all the user flows to the connected pages and buttons. 
            </p>
            <h5>What did I learn?</h5>
            <p>I learned the whole process of solving a problem from ideation to the final product. From this project, I learned how to draw wireframes and user flow. Most importantly, I got to learn to build a mockup app using Figma. 
            </p>
            <h5>What will I do in the future?</h5>
            <p>In the future, I would like to make more components and variants instead of making tons of frames. I also want to make most of the app elements interactive, such as the input box, where you can type the course or task name. If I have more time, I want to add a few more pages such as a login page. For future projects, I will save my progress more often for easier revision. </p>
